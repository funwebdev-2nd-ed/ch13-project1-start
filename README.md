# Fundamentals of Web Development, 2nd Edition
### Chapter 13 [PHP 3], Project 1 [Travel]
This exercise walks you through the usage of a static class variable, and simple data
encapsulation. It builds on the structure you have from Chapter 12 Project 2, but
replaces arrays of arrays with a single array of objects of type TravelImage.

**Note, step 6 in project 1 mistakenly instructs you to edit chapter12-project02.php. Instead, edit list.php.

Step 3 in the testing section indicates that the link's destination is travel-image.php, when it should be details.php.**
